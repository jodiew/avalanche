                <p>
                    We offer a free support group for women who have been
                    impacted by cancer. Our monthly gatherings are a chance
                    women to support each other. The groups are facilitated
                    by medical professionals who volunteer their time, but
                    the topics are mostly self guided through member
                    conversation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We offer an opportunity to share in a safe,
                    confidential environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Guest speakers are occasionally invited to present
                    current information on relevant topics such as
                    nutrition, healing plans, coping strategies and
                    wellness.

                <h2>How we started</h2>
                <p>
                    A group of 5 women living in the Sooke Region were
                    interested in initiating the development of a local breast
                    cancer support program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A focus group was held in May 2012 to ask women impacted by
                    breast cancer what they would find most beneficial in their
                    healing journey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most urgent need identified was to have a safe place
                    where they could get together for social support and to
                    share personal challenges related to their experience with
                    cancer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first monthly support group was held in June 2012. In
                    April 2016 the board voted to expand the group to all women
                    impacted by cancer.

                <h2>Fundraising</h2>
                <h3>All money raised stays in Sooke</h3>
                <p>
                    We rely on fundraising to offset the cost of this program.
                    The money is used for things such as: monthly group meeting
                    refreshments, provision of a retreat for women with cancer,
                    guest speaker honorariums, specialized training for
                    facilitators, promotion of special events to support this
                    program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our first fundraising event was the Kludak Trail Lily Walk,
                    which helped to raise just over $2,000.00.
